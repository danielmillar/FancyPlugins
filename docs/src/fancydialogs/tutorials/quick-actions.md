# Quick actions

FancyDialogs doesn't support the quick-actions hotkey, but has a command to open a quick action dialog.
To open the quick actions dialog, use the command: `/qa` or `/quickactions`.

You can customize the quick actions dialog in the `plugins/FancyDialogs/data/dialogs/quick_actions.json` file.

If you want to disable the quick actions dialog, you can set the `disable-quick-actions-dialog` option to true in the `plugins/FancyDialogs/featureFlags.yml` file.
